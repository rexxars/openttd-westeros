# openttd-westeros

Westeros inside of OpenTTD. A work in progress.

## Inspiration/material

### Overall

- https://quartermaester.info/ (for general map)
- https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Longbow_Hall (the wiki in general, and for finding smaller towns and features)
- https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Vale_of_Arryn (the wilki in general)
- https://atlasoficeandfireblog.wordpress.com/ (browse backwards in history for lots of maps, not necesarilly canon but probably good enough)

### The Vale (currently being worked on)
